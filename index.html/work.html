                    In this project I collaborated with a team to 
                    make a website for a nonprofit organization. 
                    We decided to do our local animal shelter and 
                    take feedback from interviews to design 
                    something that would give the users what 
                    we wanted. It turned out to be a really fun 
                    project and we were able to get amazing 
                    feedback on it.

                    In this project I was able to work with another partner to make a user friendly government website. We decided to go with the department of education and we are really proud of our results. We put a lot of time into this project and learned how to make the website responsive.

                    This was one of my first projects in school and we were able to design an app for a travel company. I came up with an app for roadtrips that help make your trip easier along the way based on your needs.
